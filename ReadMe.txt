To setup this plugin all you have to do is copy the .jar in the plugins folder of your server and create a test.txt in the folder above.

This plugin is still in testing and will have some errors or bugs , if you encounter one feel free to let me know.

This is my first plugin in use so be aware that there will be some errors or bad passages in my code, again if you point it out, nicely please, i am thankfull for your help.

Otherwise i hope you enjoy my little project to get to know Bukkit.

Version is 1.19
